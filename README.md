# elastic-apm-mule3-agent
## Intro
This addon allows application performance monitoring of Mule 3.x components using Elastic APM. It provides a non-intrusive way to measure and benchmark individual flows and steps in Mule, adding the application performance monitoring of Mule components to reside in Elasticsearch alongside logs, metrics and other data.

## How it works

## Setup
### Maven

### Mule flow

### Mule property configuration

## Things to consider
* Only supports Mule 3.x at this stage.
* Only captures input and output properties, no flowVars at this stage.
* Compatible with Elastic APM 6.4.x and uses APM Java client v0.7.
